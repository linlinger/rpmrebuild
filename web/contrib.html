      <h1>rpmrebuild contribution</h1>

      There is many ways to contribute to rpmrebuild project, even if you are not a developper :

      <h2>bug report</h2>
      If you find a bug, or if rpmrebuild does not work as expected, ask for <a href="support.html">support</a>

      <h2>feature request</h2>
      If you need some new feature, ask the <a href="support.html">support</a>, we are waiting for new idea.

      <h2>translation</h2>
      Coming with release 2.2.x, rpmrebuild now support message translation. English and French are provided by the developement team,
      but you can add your own translations : there is just one file to translate ( the french is for example /usr/lib/rpmrebuild/locale/fr/rpmrebuild.lang,
      a german should be /usr/lib/rpmrebuild/locale/de/rpmrebuild.lang) . If you wrote some translation, send us your file, it will be integrated in next release.
      
      <h2>plugins</h2>
      If you have written your own plugins, send us your code, so it can be shared with other users.
