      <h1>rpmrebuild's use</h1>

      <h2>basic use</h2>
      no need of rpm building knowledge

      <h3>just rebuild an rpm package from an installed package</h3>

      you do not find the rpm file ?<br />
      just type <code>rpmrebuild package_name</code>

      <h2>advanced use</h2>
      you need to have basic knowledge on rpm spec file syntax ( read the RPM-HOWTO, or go to <a href="http://www.rpm.org">rpm.org</a>)

      <h3>changes in a file</h3>
      you have changed a configuration file to match your needs, and want to distribute your changes ?<br />
      yo will use the same command : <code>rpmrebuild package_name</code>, because rpmrebuild build 
      the package from the installed files.

      <h3>add a file</h3>
      want to add a file to a package ?<br />
      Put the file on the wanted directory.<br />
      you will use <code>rpmrebuild -e package_name</code>. rpmrebuild will open the specfile in your favorite editor and
      allow you to add the wanted file in the "%files" section.

      <h3>advices</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>rpmrebuild do not need explicitly to be run on root superuser, but you have to be root if some files are root-protected (unix perms 0600)</li>
	<li>the specfile is deleted after use. If you want to keep it, use -s option</li>
	<li>the rpm files are build on "natural" location (for example, on Redhat/Centos/fedora, on /usr/src/redhat/RPMS, by default).<br />
	but you may change this with -d option or with ~/.rpmmacros file (add "%_topdir your_dir")</li>
	<li>rpmrebuild has numerous options, check them with <em>man rpmrebuild</em> or <em>rpmrebuild --help</em></li>
      </ul>
