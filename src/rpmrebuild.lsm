Description:    rpmrebuild creates spec files used by the Red Hat Package Manager
                in building RPM packages.  It uses the information it can
                determine (from the rpm database) to fill in the proper spec file fields. 
		It allows to recreate a lost rpm package or to quickly modify an
		existing one.
